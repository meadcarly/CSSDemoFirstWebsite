        <h3>My FitnessApp - C# | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | SQL | Dapper | Entity Framework | MySQL Workbench | ASP.NET Core MVC | Test-Driven Development</h3>
        <div>This app is a work in progress aimed for increasing personal health! Currently, it holds a database of exercises intended as an exercise routine building starting point, with user ability to change each exercise to fit their goal and add new exercises as inspiration hits them. It also includes a database of user measurements. Optional fields allow users to customize their user experience.
