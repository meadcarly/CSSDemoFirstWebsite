    <h3 class="about-greeting">Hi there!</h3>
    <p class="bio">My name is Carly! I am a burgeoning software developer with a passion for excellence and an adventurous spirit! When I decided I was interested in becoming a full-stack developer I went at it full of heart. I found an excellent coding bootcamp where I have been honing my skills in C# and MySQL by developing console application projects and advancing into ASP.NET Core MVC projects. I've gained experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and built my own website project, which is what you are currently looking through! During this journey I have become familiar with Git and GitHub, code editors like Ryder and Visual Studio Code, database tools like MySQL Workbench and more. It has been a whirlwind, and I'm excited to see where the future takes me!</p>
